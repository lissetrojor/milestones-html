    <h1>How do you structure an html file?</h1>
    <p>The purpose of HTML is to mark up raw content.</p>
    <h2>What do you need?</h2>
    <p>First, you need to say that this is an HTML webpage with the line &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; for browswers to look at.</p>
    <p>Then, you need &lt;html&gt; tags that opens like this &lt;html&gt; and closes like this &lt;/html&gt;.
      *It is important to remember that for every opening tag there is a closing tag* Everything inisde these tags is
      an &lt;html&gt; element that has the next folowing elements.*</p>

    <h2>The head.</h2>
    <p>The head has things like the page title, CSS stylesheets, and other things that are needed to render the page but can be hidden.
      Use open &lt;head&gt; and closed &lt;/head&gt; tags. *Notice that this element is indented twice.*</p>
    <p>The title element is used within the html tags by using open &lt;title&gt; and closed &lt;/title&gt; tags.
      This is only visible in the tab for your bage and in Google search engine results</p>

      <h2>The body.</h2>
    <p>The body has all the content that can be seen by the user like headings,
      paragraphs, images, and other content. Use open &lt;body&gt; and closed &lt;/body&gt; tags.</p>

      <h3>headings</h3>
      <p>Headings are like titles that the user can see. They are use in a hieraarchy.
      The first heading should be &lt;h1&gt; and the following headers should be &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3,... until &lt;h6&gt;.
      They become less important as it goes on. *The &lt;h1&gt; element is usally used as the displayed title of the page*</p>

      <h3>paragraphs</h3>
      <p>To add paragraphs you need to use the &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; tags within the body element with the text that you want to be seen.</p>
  </body>
</html>
