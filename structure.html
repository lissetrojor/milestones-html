  How do you structure an html file?
  The purpose of HTML is to mark up raw content.

  First, you need to say that this is an HTML webpage with the line <!DOCTYPE html> for browswers to look at.

  Then, you need <html> tags that opens like this <html> and closes like this </html>.
  *It is important to remember that for every opening
  tag there is a closing tag* Everything inisde these tags is an <html> element that has the next folowing elements.

  The head has things like the page title, CSS stylesheets, and other things that are needed to render the page but can be hidden.
  Use open <head> and closed </head> tags. *Notice that this element is indented twice.*

    The title element is used within the html tags by using open <title> and closed </title> tags.
    This is only visible in the tab for your bage and in Google search engine results

  The body has all the content that can be seen by the user like headings,
  paragraphs, images, and other content. Use open <body> and closed </body> tags.

    Headings are like titles that the user can see. They are use in a hieraarchy.
    The first heading should be <h1> and the following headers should be <h2>, <h3,... until <h6>.
    They become less important as it goes on. *The <h1> element is usally used as the displayed title of the page*

    To add paragraphs you need to use the <p> </p> tags within the body element with the text that you want to be seen.
