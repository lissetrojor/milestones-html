The anchor tag is a child of the paragraph tag because the anchor tag can be found after the opened <p> but before the </p> tag.
The <p> means that the paragraph tag is opened while the </p> tag means that the tag is closed.
The <a> means that the paragraph tag is opened while the </a> tag means that the tag is closed.

The anchor element has the attribute of a href link, an id, a class, and a target.
The value of the href is the link leading to google.com. This makes links.
The value for the id is the name "the-best-link." This makes an id name that can be called in either the css file or the java script file.
The value of the class is "banana" and the value for the target is "_blank." The class can also be called in either the css file or the java script file.
